    <p>My name is <strong>Abdul Samad</strong>, and my father name is <strong>Umara Khan</strong>.I am graduated from <abbr title="University of Engineering and Technology">UET</abbr> Peshawar, in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong>.
  I am passionate about <em>CAD designing, research, and simulation</em>, with hands-on experience in 
  CAD softwares (Creo Parametric, SolidWorks, AutoCAD), CFD analysis (Ansys Fluent), and project management using Primavera P6. I had done my FSc from 
  <abbr title="Rahman Group of Colleges">RGoC</abbr> Fazal Abad, Mardan. And I had done metriculation from 
  <abbr title="Govt. High School">GHS</abbr> Khadi Killi, Mardan.</p> <br>

  <p>I am honored to have received a prize from <b>MPA Iftikhar Ali Mashwani</b> and <abbr title="Rahman Group of Colleges">RGOC's</abbr> <abbr title="Management Director"> MD </abbr><b>Rahman Saab</b> in recognition of my performance
  in the Engineering Entrance Test, where I secured excellent marks. This achievement reflects my hard
  work, dedication, and passion for engineering. I am truly grateful for this acknowledgment and motivated
  to continue striving for excellence in my academic and professional journey.</p>
